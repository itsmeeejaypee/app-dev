## *Kingsman: The Secret Service*
______________________________________________________________________
Kingsman: The Secret Service is a great and fantastic movie, from the plot, choreography, cast choices, action scenes, suspense, violence, and humor. It is one of
the best spy movies ever made. I have watched this movie for over a hundred times. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I give this movie a rating of 10/10.
## *Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion*
______________________________________________________________________
Code Geass is a work of art and a masterpiece in every sense. While there are other anime series that tackles politics, no other series have done it so like Code
Geass. The show is a political thriller and shows all the sides of the conflict. There are no good sides and bad sides, which is a realistic mentality many people
possesses. This anime is one of my all-time favorites because of its charismatic, manipulative, intelligent, and cunning protagonist, Lelouch vi Britannia.
